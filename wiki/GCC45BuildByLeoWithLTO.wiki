Link Time Optimization (LTO) is a new optimization strategy in GCC 4.5, it works great. See
GCC wiki page [1] for details.

LTO on non-ELF platform is implemented/patched by Dave Korn [2], his patch was already in trunk, but not in GCC 4.5.0, he kindly provided a patch for GCC 4.5.0 [2].

= Build Notes =
 * Only two patches, coff-section-directive-alignment.diff (not necessary if binutils 2.20.1) and gcc_lto-coff-respin-4.diff.
 * Apply patches as normal, but *don't forget to run autoconf 2.64 at srcdir and srcdir/gcc *, * autoconf before 2.63 is not working, for autoconf 2.65 or later, simple modifications on srcdir/configure.ac and srcdir/config/override.m4 are needed. *
 * replace --disable-lto with --enable-lto in gcc configure step.
