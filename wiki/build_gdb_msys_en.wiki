#This article describes build gdb under MSYS + MinGW environment from the latest version of gdb source(git update)

= prerequisite  =
==unzip tools==
I recommend using latest version of [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-Zip].

==GCC compiler suite==
I use Loaden's MinGW GCC suite[http://code.google.com/p/qp-gcc/downloads/detail?name=mingw-static-4.4.5-all.7z&can=2&q= Loaden'GCC]. Note you should have iconv library in your compiler suite, other wise, gdb need iconv to show Unicode characters correctly. Also, Pcx's MinGW GCC suite [http://pcxprj.googlecode.com/files/MinGW_gcc4.5.4.20110428_static_win32.7z MinGW_gcc4.5.4.20110428_static_win32] is also a good alternative.

==use MSYSgit to download the latest gdb source code==
gdb's source code is based on the cvs, but there is a readable git. I use a portable version of [http://msysgit.googlecode.com/files/PortableGit-1.7.4-preview20110204.7z PortableGit-1.7.4] client to check out the source code. Note that you should firstly edit the file "\etc\gitconfig", change the text "autocrlf=true" to "autocrlf = false".
 
Next, run the command git-bash.bat, then you can go to download the gdb source code using this command: 

{{{
git clone git://sourceware.org/git/gdb.git
}}}

== install python2.7==
This is quite simple step, just go to python official site, and download [http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.1/python-2.7.1.msi Python 2.7.1 Windows Installer] and install it.

==Download MSYS shell==
The MSYS shell package can be downloaded from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/External%20binary%20packages%20%28Win64%20hosted%29/MSYS%20%2832-bit%29/MSYS-20110309.zip/download MSYS-20110309.zip], unzip it and configure the file "\msys\etc\fstab", if the file does not exist, you need to create one yourself, it is just a text file without file extension, then edit it like below:
{{{
D:/code/MinGWLoaden /mingw
F:/cb/python271 /python
}}}
This will mount the mingw and python path correctly.

==expat library==
Expat library is used to support gdb to debug dll files. Download 
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/expat/expat-2.0.1-1/expat-2.0.1-1-mingw32-src.tar.gz/download expat-2.0.1-1-mingw32-src.tar.gz] and extract it.

=Build=
==build expat library==
Run the MSYS, change directory to where your extract expat, and run the command
{{{
./configure -prefix=/E/test/expat/install --enable-static
make
make install
}}}
Now, you have static expat under "/E/test/expat/install".

==Configure python header path and libraries==

There is a trick to use python library.

 # Suppose you python is installed under "F:\cb\python271"ï¼ŒThe header files were located under "F:\cb\python271\include", You need to create a new folder"F:\cb\python271\include\python2.7", and copy all the files from "F:\cb\python271\include"
 # Change the library file name, make a copy of "F:\cb\python271\libslibpython27.a" and rename to "libpython2.7.a"

==build gdb==
Under MSYS shell, go to your gdb source, On my computer, it is "E:\test\unix_gdb\gdb", create an empty folder "E:\test\unix_gdb\build".
Then, run the configure command below:
{{{
cd build
../gdb/configure --prefix=/E/test/install --build=mingw32 --host=mingw32 --target=mingw32 \
   CFLAGS="-s -L/python/libs -I/python/include -I/E/test/expat/install/include -static -L/E/test/expat/install/lib" \
   --with-python \
   --with-expat
}}}

Then, just make and make install, it will take several minutes to build the gdb.
{{{
make
make install
}}}

That's all, the final gdb will be installed in "/E/test/install"


=Other things to need to know=
To update your gdb source code, you need to open MSYSgit, and  run the command under gdb source folder.
{{{ git pull }}}

==Acknowledgement==
Many thanks to Loaden to suppy a working MinGW GCC and give us a cross gdb instruction.
Many thanks to Pcx with who I solved many problems when building gdb under MSYS.
