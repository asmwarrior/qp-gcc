= How to use =

You can download the package 
http://qp-gcc.googlecode.com/files/gdb7.1.50.20100623cvs.7z
And extract to your *MinGW/bin* folder
Note, the package already contains all the python binaries, so you don't need to install python any more.


= Load the python sciprt when Debugger started in Codeblocks ==
If you use the latest Codeblocks Codecompletion_branch, you can setting the debug like below
[http://i683.photobucket.com/albums/vv194/ollydbg_cb/debugger_setting1.png]
{{{
source $(TARGET_COMPILER_DIR)bin\stl.gdb
source $(TARGET_COMPILER_DIR)bin\wx.gdb
}}}
This will run the the two gdb file when gdb started. 
If you use official Codeblocks or nightlies, you need to specify the path of your MinGW, so it is some thing like:
{{{
source D:\MinGW\bin\stl.gdb
source D:\MinGW\bin\wx.gdb
}}}

= Then, enjoying debugging =
